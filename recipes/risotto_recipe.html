        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>300g risotto rice</li>
            <li>1 Â¼l chicken stock or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>150g frozen peas</li>
            <li>180g ham hock, diced</li>
            <li>2 tsp English mustard</li>
            <li>3 tbsp mascarpone</li>
            <li>100g mature cheddar, grated, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
            <li>70g bag pea shoots (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish and cook the onion for 5 mins over a medium heat to soften. Stir in the garlic and the risotto rice, and cook for another 30 secs-1 min. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, then cover and cook for about 15 mins on a medium heat, stirring every so often. The rice should be almost done.</li>
            <li>Add the peas, ham, mustard and cheeses to the pan, and cook for another few mins until the rice is just right and the cheese melted. Season and serve topped with a handful of the pea shoots and a little extra cheese, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
